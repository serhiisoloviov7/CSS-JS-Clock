# CSS & JavaScript Clock

A stylish and functional analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to use CSS for clock styling and JavaScript to animate the clock hands in real-time.

## Features
- **Analog Clock Design**: A clean and elegant clock face with hour markers.
- **Smooth Animation**: Clock hands update dynamically based on the current time.
- **Realistic Shadows**: Enhanced styling with box shadows for a 3D effect.
- **Background Styling**: Beautiful background image applied with CSS.
- **Custom Hour Markers**: Dynamically generated hour markers using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the clock.
- **CSS**: Styling, including shadows and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to update clock hands every second.

## How It Works
1. The JavaScript function `setDate()` retrieves the current time using `Date()`.
2. It calculates the angles for the hour, minute, and second hands.
3. The hands rotate dynamically using CSS transformations.
4. Custom hour markers are positioned using JavaScript and trigonometric calculations.
